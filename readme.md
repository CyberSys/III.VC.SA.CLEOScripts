# III.VC.SA.CLEOScripts

All scripts presented on this page require CLEO library. CLEO 2.0 for GTA3 and VC, CLEO 4 for GTA SA and the latest version of CLEO for Android.

Besides that, for most PC scripts, GInput is required:

So, even if you donâ€™t have a gamepad, you need to install GInput anyway to use these scripts.

To install scripts simple put .cs file in CLEO folder. 
If there's a zip archive on release page, then the script requires additional files, copy the content of that archive to GTA root directory.
